  <title>DHIS2 Documentation Guide</title>
  <section xml:id="docs_1">
    <title>DHIS2 Documentation System Overview</title>
    <para remap="">DHIS2 is a web-based  information management system under very active
      development with typically four releases per year. Each release typically includes a number of
      new features and additional functionality.  Given the fast pace of development, the system's
      wide user base and distributed, global nature of development, a comprehensive documentation
      system is required. An in-depth discussion of the need for documentation of DHIS2 has been
      considered previously.<citation>Store2007</citation>
      <link xl:href="http://www.docbook.org">DocBook</link> is a comprehensive, standard XML based
      markup language for  the creation of books, papers and other technical documents maintained by
        <link xl:href=" http://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</link> . In this chapter, we will describe
      the documentation system of DHIS2 and how you can contribute. </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="docs_2">
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>One of the main advantages of <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="http://docbook.org/whatis">DocBook</link> is that there is complete separation
      between the content and presentation. DocBook is a pure XML markup format used for technical
      documentation. In spite of the hundreds of tags which DocBook supports, only a very small
      subset of its features are currently used for the DHIS2 documentation. Since DocBook can be
      transformed into a wide variety of formats (HTML, PDF, etc) and is a text-based format, it
      serves as an ideal format for documentation of the system.</para>
<para>There exist a wide range of text editors which can be used for the creation of DocBook files.
      A fairly complete list of possibilities is located <link
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookAuthoringTools">here</link>. It is
      currently recommended to use the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="https://www.oxygenxml.com"><trademark class="registered">
          &lt;oXygen/&gt;</trademark> XML editor</link> for editing DocBook source files. In
      principle, any text editing program or XML editor can be used to author DocBook files. Other
      good possibilities are excellent and freely available text editor<link
        xl:href="http://jedit.org/">jEdit</link> with the XML plugin installed, or the <link
        xl:href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">cross-platform Emacs</link> text editor. Both
      of these programs support editing DocBook XML. </para>

    <para>One of the key concepts to keep in mind when authoring documentation in DocBook, or other
      presentation neutral formats, is that the <emphasis role="bold">content</emphasis> of the
      document should be considered first. The <emphasis role="bold">presentation</emphasis> of the
      document will take place in a separate transformation step, whereby the source XML will be
      rendered into different formats, such as HTML and PDF.  It is therefore important that the
      document is well organised and structured, with appropriate tags and structural elements being
      considered.</para>
    <para>It is good practice to break your document in to various sections using the
        <tag>sect</tag> tag. It is easy to make use of the modular nature of DocBook, and split very
      complex chapters into smaller, more manageable pieces. This concept is essentially the same as
        <trademark class="registered">Microsoft Word</trademark> or other word processing programs.
      DocBook will automatically take care of numbering the sections for you when the document is
      produced. </para>
    <para>Two other important elements are the <tag>itemizedlist</tag> and<tag> numberedlist</tag>.
      These are quite similar, but an itemised list corresponds to a bulleted list, which a numbered
      list will be rendered with each element being numbered sequentially. Other key elements are
        <tag>screenshot</tag> and <tag>table</tag> which should be self-explanatory. </para>
    <para>The reader is referered to the DocBook documentation for a more in-depth description of
      the exact elements which are availbale to be used. Currently, the DHIS2 documentation is
      using version 5.0 of DocBook.</para>

    <title>Getting started with GitHub</title>
    <para>The DHIS2 documentation system is managed at <link
        xl:href="https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-docbook-docs">GitHub</link> in its own source code
      repository. GitHub is a collaborative platform that enables multiple people to work on
      software projects collaboratively. In order for this to be possible, a version control system
      is necessary in order to manage all the changes that multiple users may make. GitHub uses the
        <emphasis>git</emphasis> source control system. While it is beyond the scope of this
      document to describe the functionality of <emphasis>git</emphasis>, users who wish to create
      documentation will need to gain at least a basic understanding of how the system works. A
      basic guide is provided in the next section. The reader is referred to the <link
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">git
        manual</link> for futher more detailed information.  </para>
    <para>In order to start adding or editing the documentation, you should first perform a checkout
      of the source code. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will need to get one.
      This can be done <link xl:href="https://github.com/">here</link>. Once you register with
      GitHub, you will need to request access to the<emphasis> dhis2-documenters</emphasis> group if
      you wish to modify the source code of the documentation directly.</para>
    <para>Login to GitHub, and then file an issue <link
        xl:href="https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2docs/issues/new">here</link>. Your request will need
      to be approved by the group administrators. Once you have been granted access to the group,
      you can commit changes to the documentation branch and send and receive notifications if you
      wish. Alternatively, you can clone the documentation into your own repository, commit your
      changes to your own fork, and request that your changes be merged with the source of the
      documenation with a pull request <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-docs/pulls">here</link>.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="docs_4">
    <title>Getting the document source</title>
    <para>In order to edit the documentation, you will need to download the source  of the
      documentation to your computer. GitHub uses a version control system known as git . There are
      different methods for getting Git working on your system, depending on which operating system
      you are using. A good step-by-step guide for <trademark class="registered"
        >Microsoft</trademark> operating systems can be viewed <link
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows"
        >here</link>. Alternatively, if you are comfortable using the command line, you can download
      git from <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">this page</link> If you are using Linux, you
      will need to install git on your system through your package manager, or from source code. A
      very thorough reference for how git is used is available in a number of different formats
        <link xl:href="http://git-scm.com/book">here</link>.</para>
    <para>Once you have installed git on your system, you will need to download the document source.
Just follow this procedure:</para>

downloaded to the folder that you specified.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The DHIS2 documents depend on other branches for their documentation. Be sure to keep
          these these up to date as well. When you build the documentation, the necessary submodules
          will be downloaded automatically as part of the build process ,if you have not already
          done so. </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> Once you have the source, be sure to create your own branch for editing. Simply
            execute<command> git checkout -b mybranch</command> where <emphasis>mybranch</emphasis>
          is the name of the branch you wish to create. </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="docs_5">
    <title>Editing the documentation</title>
    <para>Once you have downloaded the source, you should have a series of folders inside of the
      repository directory.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Place all files in a folder in the following format

      <listitem>
        <para>Place images that you linked to in the
            <filename>/dhis2docs/src/docbkx/XX/resources/images</filename> folder. Link these inside
          your DocBook file using a relative file link. When the documentation is built, in a
          separate step, the images will be automatically copied over to the correct

    <title>DHIS2 Bibliography</title>
    <para>DHIS2 has a rich set of academic literature which can serve as useful resources during
      implementations, project proposals and more detailed reading than what is appropriate for a
      general user manual. A specialized bibliography has been added to the source code of the
      application. <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="http://www.bibtex.org">BibTeX</link> is a specialized language which is widely
      used in the academic world to handle bibliographic databases. A large number of free and open
      source tools are capable of working with BibTeX. Currently, the recommended tool of choice for
      manipulating the DHIS2 bibliography is <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net/">JabRef</link>. </para>
    <para>To get started with the bibliography, download a copy of JabRef and open the
        <filename>/src/bibliography/dhis2_bibliography.bib file</filename>. . Add some new
      references, then export the bibliography back to the
        <filename>/src/docbkx/en/dhis2_bibliography.xml</filename> file, using the DocBook 5.0
      export format. The updated bibliography will automatically be included in the documentation
      after you commit your changes.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="docs_6">
    <title>Using images</title>
    <para>Screen shots are very useful for providing information to users on how particular actions
should be performed. DocBook has no intrinsic mechanisms to know exactly how an image should be rendered in the final document. Therefore, it is necessary to provide instructions through element attributes. The following XML code fragment demonstrates how an image can be specified to occupy 80% of the available page width. For screen shots in landscape format, this seems to be an appropriate amount. You may need to experiment a bit to obtain a proper width for your image. Alternatively, you can edit the resolution of the image itself, in order to obtain a proper size during rendering. </para>
    <programlisting>&lt;screenshot&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;DHIS2 Login screen&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;mediaobject&gt;
   &lt;imageobject&gt; 
    &lt;imagedata fileref=&quot;resources/images/login/dhis2_login_screen.jpg&quot; format=&quot;JPG&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/imageobject&gt;
  &lt;/mediaobject&gt; 
&lt;/screenshot&gt;</programlisting>
    <para>For other images, depending on their size, a different value may be necessary. If you do
not specify a width for you image, and its intrinsic size is larger than the available screen width, the image may overflow in certain document types with a fixed width, such as PDF. </para>
    <para>Its is important that all images begin with <filename>resources/images/XXXX</filename>
      where XXXX is the folder where the image is actually located. When the documentation is
      actually built, the images will be copied into the correct location for the different formats.
      If you are having trouble seeing the image in your editor, be sure you create a symlink to
      this folder in the corresponding documents <filename>content</filename> folder. </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="docs_7">
    <title>Linking documents together</title>
    <para>DocBook provides a modular framework where many separate documents can be linked together
into a master document. Fragments from different documents can also be reused in different contexts. It is therefore important to consider whether your document should be constructed as an article or a chapter. Chapters are essentially portions of a book, and can therefore be linked together into a larger document very easily. Articles are essentially standalone documents, but they can also be assembled together into a larger document at the component level. </para>
    <para>Should you wish to link several articles together into a book, DocBook provides a
mechanism to assign an id to a section. In the example below, a section has been assigned an id. This id must be unique within the document. </para>
    <para>
<programlisting>  &lt;section xml:id=&quot;mod2_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Getting started with DHIS2&lt;/title&gt; ....</programlisting> </para>
    <para>In order to include an article into a book, an Xinclude statement must be used. The
following example shows how. </para>
    <para>
<programlisting>&lt;chapter&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Getting started with DHIS2&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;xi:include xmlns:xi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude&quot; href=&quot;dhis2_user_man_mod2.xml&quot;
 xpointer=&quot;mod2_1&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt;
... </programlisting>
</para>
    <para>Note that the file name and id have been assigned in the parent document, referring to the
actual file (href) and particular fragment of the child document that should be referenced in the parent document (xpointer). </para>
    <para>Including chapters in a book is very simple. The example below illustrates how: </para>
    <para><programlisting>&lt;xi:include xmlns:xi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude&quot; href=&quot;dhis2_user_man_
mod1.xml&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt; </programlisting>
</para>
    <para>In this case, there is no need to explicitly reference a part of the document, unless you
only want to include a portion of the chapter. If you want to use a section of the chapter, you can assign an id to that section, and then reference that section through an xpointer. </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="docs_8">
    <title>Handling multilingual documentation</title>
    <para>The DHIS2 docuemtnation has been translated into a number of different languages including
      French, Spanish and Portuguese. If you would like to create a translation of the documentation
      or contribute to one of the exisiting translations, please contact the DHIS2 documentation
      team at the email provided at the end of this chapter. </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="docs_9">
    <title>Building the documentation</title>
    <para>One of the key advantages of the DocBook format is that the source documentation can be
      transformed into a wide variety of formats, including HTML, chunked HTML, XHTML, PDF, and a
      number of other formats. There are a wide variety of tools that are capable of performing this
      task. Basically the XML source of the document is transformed using the standard <link
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl/">DocBook XSL style
        sheets</link> into the desired output  format. The complete list of tools capable of
      transforming DocBook will not be listed here, but a few examples are provided below. </para>
    <para>Latest builds of the documentation are available from the <link

      <title>Building the documentation with Apache maven</title>
      <para>In order to transform the documentation source files to different formats, such as HTML
or PDF, you will need to install the Apache Maven program. You can get a copy <link xl:href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">here</link> or by installing it through your package manager if you are using Linux. Just execute the command <command>mvn clean package</command> on Windows or on Linux from the <filename>/dhis2-docbook-docs </filename>directory. Maven will start to download the necessary components to transform the
documents into HMTL,PDF and RTF. Once the process has completed (be patient the first time, as there are a number of components that must be downloaded), all of the target document types will be generated in the /<filename>dhis2docs/target/docbkx</filename> directory in respective sub-directories.</para>

    <title>Committing your changes back to GitHub</title>
    <para>Once you have finished editing your document, you will need to commit your changes back to
      GitHub. Open up a command prompt on Windows or a shell on Linux, and navigate to the folder
      where you have placed your documentation. If you have added any new files or folders to your
      local repository, you will need to add them to the source tree with the <command>git add
      </command> command, followed by the folder or file name(s) that you have added. Be sure to
      include a descriptive comment with your commit. <cmdsynopsis>
        <command>git commit </command>
        <arg>-m</arg>
        <arg>&quot;Improved documentation on organisation unit imports with CSV."</arg>
      </cmdsynopsis>Finally, you should push the changes back to the repository with <command>git
        push origin mybranch</command>, where "mybranch" is the name of the branch which you created
      when you checked out the document source or which you happent o be working on.  In order to do
      this, you will need the necessary permissions to commit to the repository.When you have
      committed your changes, <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-docs/pulls">you can issue a pull request</link>
      to have them merged with the master branch. You changes will be reviewed by the core
      documentation team and tested to ensure they do not break the build, as well as reviwed for
      quality.  As mentioned previously, you can also push your changes to your own GitHub repo, if
      you do not have access to the main repo, and submit a pull request for your changes to be
      merged.</para>
    <para>If you have any questions, or cannot find that you can get started, just send an email
with your problem to <email>dhis2-documenters@lists.launchpad.net</email>.</para>
